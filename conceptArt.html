            Currently, I haven't completed my art for the game outside of getting some conceptual ideas down. I plan to focus more on this
            aspect as I get further along in coding. Art is one of my many hobbies, and although I am by no means a professional, it is
            something I very much enjoy.

            When doing pixel art I find it's very helpful to have some sort of reference or sketch, even if hastily put together. This is
            one of the first sketches I made, to plan out the looks for some tiles.
