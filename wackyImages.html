        In programming, expect the unexpected.

        Here's a collection of some past images taken during development and debugging, that were so wild I had to capture the moment.

        <figcaption>16 December 2022</figcaption>
        <figcaption>A glitch from some of the first attempts at calculating and rendering light. The effect is cool, but not quite what I was going for.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>27 January 2023</figcaption>
        <figcaption>Something's wrong with the debug menu here. Also the background looks a little... off.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>27 February 2023</figcaption>
        <figcaption>Glich where shadows were being rendered on the wrong side of the object.</figcaption>

        <img src="images/wackyImages/lightAttempts27Feb2023.png" alt="Game Image" width="35%">
        <figcaption>27 February 2023</figcaption>
        <figcaption>Shadows (shown in red for testing purposes) rendered all coming from the top left of the screen. That was a fun one to fix.</figcaption>

        <img src="images/wackyImages/lightAttempts24April2023.png" alt="Game Image" width="35%">
        <figcaption>24 April 2023</figcaption>
        <figcaption>I'll be honest, I don't remeber what caused this glitch, but the lights were being rendered in all sorts of strange configurations.</figcaption>

        <img src="images/wackyImages/newTiles30May2023.png" alt="Game Image" width="35%">
        <figcaption>30 May 2023</figcaption>
        <figcaption>One of the first attemps at rendering a tilemap with the new tileset I made. As you can see, there were a few slight problems. This one's a personal favorite.</figcaption>

        <img src="images/wackyImages/strangeEffect1June2023.png" alt="Game Image" width="35%">
        <figcaption>1 June 2023</figcaption>
        <figcaption>A strange lighting effect I found while messing with rendering. I think this one is quite pretty, enough so that I might find a way to implement it.</figcaption>
