        <h1>Known Bugs and Glitches</h1>
        <p>
            A project so large is bound to have some problems. This is a list of some of the glitches and bugs that I am aware of.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Fullscreen and Light</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently adding a toggleable mode that will allow the user to switch between windowed and fullscreen mode, but a strange glitch
                occurs where the entire tilemap vanishes from sight. I have determined that the re-rendering of light is somehow causing this issue.
            </p>

                <figcaption>An example of the result of toggling between fullscreen and windowed mode.</figcaption>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Player Jump Glitch</h2>
            <p>
                If the player jumps and lands on the very edge of a tile, the game will think that they are still falling and they will not be able to
                jump again unless they move.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has been a known issue for a while now, because it does not affect development, but it will affect the player experience. I've had plans
                to add some upgrades to the player motion system, so debugging this will probably wait until then.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Loading a New Level</h2>
            <p>
                Loading a level is a complicated task, since every single tile on the map needs to get read and processed, so it's no surprise that
                loading up a new level causes a massive drop in performace. I plan on adding some sort of waiting state between levels, to handle performance
                issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wouldn't classify this as a bug, but it's an issue that needs to be taken care of.
