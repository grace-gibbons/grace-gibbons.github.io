            Welcome to the beginnings of my 2D tile based game, where I am creating the framework required to create a fully functional
            video game. The purpose of this project is mainly for my own entertainmant and education. I have had a lot of fun putting this
            together and this project was my first exposure to programming in C++. It acts as a opportunity for me to learn, practice debugging,
            and put my skills to the test.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is written in C++ using SDL. It was started on July 12, 2022 and I have been working on it since then.
