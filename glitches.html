        <h1>Known Bugs and Glitches</h1>
        <p>
            A large project is bound to have some problems. This is a list of some of the glitches and bugs that I am aware of.
        </p>

            <h2>Fullscreen and Light</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently adding a toggleable mode that will allow the user to switch between windowed and fullscreen mode, but a strange glitch
                occurs where the entire tilemap vanishes from sight. I have determined that the re-rendering of light is somehow causing this issue.
                <br />
                Update: This problem has been solved, but a similar issue persists when tested on another device.
            </p>

            <h2>Loading a New Level</h2>
            <p>
                Loading a level is a complicated task, since every single tile on the map needs to get read and processed, so it's no surprise that
                loading up a new level causes a massive drop in performace. I plan on adding some sort of waiting state between levels, to handle performance
                issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wouldn't classify this as a bug, but it's an issue that needs to be taken care of.
